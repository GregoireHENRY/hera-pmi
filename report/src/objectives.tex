\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:3}

Following the former document, the main objectif of this paper is to have a more complex thermophysical model to get closer to the reality. The heat flux from the Sun is the main source of heating for asteroids but there are more phenomenons happening to implement and especially for a binary system of asteroid. The most important from the secondary effects is the mutual heating between the two bodies of the binary system. Another effect to implement for crateres or rough-shape asteroids is the self heating. This paper also aims to present a method to include the asteroid obliquity in our model. The document is mainly focused on the study of Didymos's secondary object Didymoon but it also presents another planetary defense mission with very different orbital and asteroid parameters which is interesting for comprehension purposes.
