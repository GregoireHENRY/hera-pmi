We would like to express our sincerest appreciation to our supervisors at the Royal Observatory of Belgium, Özgür Karatekin and Elodie Gloesener, as well as everyone who has been involved with us on our master thesis project since day one: Bart Van Hove and Zhu Ping from the Royal Observatory of Belgium, and Baptiste Rubino from IPSA. Thank you for accompanying us through this trip into the Solar System.
