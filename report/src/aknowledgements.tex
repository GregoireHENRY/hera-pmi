We would like to express our sincerest appreciation to our supervisors at the Royal Observatory of Belgium, Ozg√ºr Karatekin and Elodie Gloesner, as well as everyone who has been involved with us on our master thesis project since day one: Bart Van Hove and Zu Ping from the Royal Observatory of Belgium, and Baptiste Rubino from IPSA. Thank you for accompanying us through this trip through the Solar System.
