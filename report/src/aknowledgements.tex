We would like to express our sincerest appreciation to our supervisors at the Royal Observatory of Belgium, Özgür Karatekin and Elodie Gloesener, as well as everyone who has been involved with us on our master thesis project since day one: Bart Van Hove and Zhu Ping from the Royal Observatory of Belgium, and Baptiste Rubino from IPSA. Thank you for accompanying us through this trip into the Solar System.

A huge thanks to everyone we met and with whom we discussed of the project. To our friends from the Observatory, Elisa Tasev, Amedeo Romagnolo, Alfonso Caldiero, Sebastien Le Maistre, Matthias Noeker.

To all admirable workers for ESA we had the chance to speak with, we think to Marc Costa Sitja, to Alessandro Zuccaro Marchi, to Ingeborg Joris.
