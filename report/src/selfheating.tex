\section{Advanced thermophysical model for rough surface including cratere}
\label{selfheating}

In this section we present the implement of the self heating. A normal at the surface of an asteroid may appear to be hidden from the direct solar flux even if it situated in the day side, for instance inside a cratere. In this scenario, it is important to take in consideration what is called the self heating of the asteroid. Due to its albedo, the surface of the asteroid relfects sunlight rays and thus, if the asteroid is not pure smooth, some reflected rays might impact another location on the asteroid.
