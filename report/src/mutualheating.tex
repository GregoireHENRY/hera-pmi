\section{A thermophysical model for a binary system of asteroids}
\label{mutual}

In this section, we present the implementation of the mutual heating. As Didymos is a binary system of asteroid, the current thermophysical model is not enough to fully describe the temperature at the surface of the asteroid. The Hera mission focuses on the secondary object in this binary system. Its surface temperature depends also on the primary object for two main reasons: 2) the reflection of the Sun on the surface of the primary to the secondary, this phenomenon depends on the primary albedo and on its position with respect to the Sun and the secondary, and it is named the mutual direct heating, 2) the heat received from the primary itself, just as the Sun, considering it as a black body, it only depend on the distance and is called the mutual diffuse heating.
