1.1  Purpose and Scope                                                        
                                                                              
This Experiment to Archive Interface Control Document (EAICD) has two main    
purposes. Firstly, it gives users of the Navigation Camera (NavCam) instrument
data a detailed description of the product and how it was generated, including
data sources and destinations. Secondly, it acts as an interface between the  
NavCam data producers and the data archiving authority. One point of note is  
that there are two identical NavCams installed on the Rosetta spacecraft,     
however, for the purposes of this document the singular is generally referred 
to when discussing the NavCams.                                               
                                                                              
1.2  Archiving Authorities                                                    
                                                                              
The Planetary Data System (PDS) standard is used as the archiving standard by:
                                                                              
    - the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for U.S.       
    Planetary Missions, implemented by PDS;                                   
                                                                              
    - the European Space Agency (ESA) for European Planetary Missions,        
    implemented by the Science Operations Department (SCIOPS) of ESA.         
                                                                              
ESA implements an on-line science archive, the Planetary  (PSA), for several  
reasons:                                                                      
                                                                              
    - to support and ease data ingestion;                                     
                                                                              
     - to offer additional services to the scientific user community and      
     science operations teams, such as, e.g.:                                 
                                                                              
         1.  queries that allow searches across instruments, missions        
         and scientific disciplines;                                          
                                                                              
         2.  several data delivery options, such as:                          
             - direct download of data products, linked files and datasets;  
             - file transfer protocol (ftp) download of data products, linked 
             files and datasets.                                             
                                                                              
The PSA aims for on-line ingestion of logical archive volumes and will offer  
the creation of physical archive volumes on request.                          
                                                                              
1.3  Contents                                                                 
                                                                              
This document describes the data flow of the NavCam instrument on Rosetta     
from the Spacecraft (S/C) until the insertion into the PSA by ESA. It includes
information on how data were processed, formatted, labelled and uniquely      
identified; along with discussing the general naming schemes for NavCam data  
volumes, datasets, data and label files. The standards used to generate such 
products are explained and the design of the dataset structure and data      
products are also given within this document.

2  Overview of Instrument Design                                              
                                                                              
In order to fully satisfy the requirements and objectives regarding navigation
and attitude control, Galileo Avionica developed a mission-specific Navigation
Camera for Rosetta by building on the heritage of existing models. Table 4    
provides an overview of some of the physical and operational parameters of the
NavCam (from [RD2]).

2.1  Architecture and Con gurations                                           
                                                                              
The Rosetta NavCam consists of a Camera Optical Head (CAM-OH), a Camera       
Electronic (CAM-EU) and a Camera Baffle (CAM-BAF). Information given in this  
section is mainly extracted from the User's Manual [RD1] and the Design       
Description Document [RD2]. In general the Rosetta NavCam camera has three    
major functions:                                                              
                                                                              
1.  Track point-like targets (in Point Target Tracking Mode).                 
                                                                              
2.  Track one extended object, during asteroid y-by and comet approach phases 
(in Asteroid Tracking Mode).                                                  
                                                                              
3.  Acquire navigation images of asteroids and the comet nucleus (Imaging     
mode, also per-formed in Asteroid Tracking Mode).                             
                                                                              
2.1.1  Camera Optical Head                                                    
                                                                              
The Camera Optical Head for the Rosetta NavCam contains the optical system,   
the CCD detector and the electronics required to operate the CCD. It also     
supports the dust cover and attenuation mechanism in front of the optics.     
Figure 1 depicts three possible configurations of the optical system with     
exchangeable first element.                                                   
                                                                              
- DNA mode. Defocused not attenuated. The first element is a plano-parallel   
window. The aperture is 70mm. This mode is used for determining the position  
of point sources with improved centroiding. During the comet escort phase this
mode is also used by default as a dust cover when the camera is not operated. 
                                                                              
 ROSETTA:CAM_COVER_POSITION = DEFOC_NATT                                      
                                                                              
- FA mode. Focused attenuated. The first lens is a quasi-plano parallel       
window, i.e. a lens with a very low converging power, in order to focus the   
image on the CCD. One face has an attenuation coating in order to decrease the 
transmission. The aperture is 30mm. This mode is used for imaging and         
navigation close to the extended comet nucleus.                               
                                                                              
 ROSETTA:CAM_COVER_POSITION = FOC_ATT                                         
                                                                              
- FNA mode. Focused not attenuated. The first lens is a quasi-plano parallel  
window with an aperture of 70mm. The image is focused on the CCD and there is 
no attenuation coating.                                                       
                                                                              
 ROSETTA:CAM_COVER_POSITION = FOC_NATT.                                       
                                                                              
For each acquired image the mission specific keyword                          
ROSETTA:CAM_COVER_POSITION records the applicable cover position in the       
meta-information of the data product files (see Table 14). The effects of the 
reduced aperture and the attenuation coating combined result in a reduction of
the transmission by a factor of 580 for the attenuated mode. For the defocused
mode the point spread function is broader. For a point source located in the  
centre of a pixel approximately 50-55% of the signal are counted in the       
respective pixel, whereas this fraction ranges between 65 and 70% for the     
focused modes.                                                                
                                                                              
Figure 1: Optical system of the NavCam with exchangeable first element. The   
lenses are made of radiation resistant glasses with high transmission in the  
visible wavelength range (LAK9 G15 and SF6 G05 produced by Schott) [RD2].    
                                                                              
The CCD detector is a front-illuminated frame transfer device with a broad    
spectral sensitivity in the visible range. Two different values of the gain   
can be selected when commanding the camera.                                   
                                                                              
1. High Gain -- 10 electrons per Digital Number. Increases the grey signal
level resolution when faint targets are imaged. In this case the A/D Converter 
saturates (at 12 bits) before saturation of the CCD is reached.
ROSETTA:CAM_GAIN = HIGH                     
                                                                              
2. Low Gain -- 17 electrons per Digital Number. The A/D Converter saturates 
at the same time as the CCD and so the full dynamic range can be used.         
ROSETTA:CAM_GAIN = LOW                                                        
                                                                              
The relative amplification factor between high and low gain is approximately 1.7.
The chosen gain settings are documented in the mission specific keyword           
ROSETTA:CAM_GAIN of the product files (see Table 14).                         
                                                                              
2.1.2  Camera Electronic Unit                                                 
                                                                              
The Camera Electronic Unit contains the digital electronics and interfaces for
data transfer with the Avionics Interface Unit (AIU) and the Solid State Mass 
Memory (SSMM). Another major function of this module is to provide the        
programmable constant-current driver for both the heater in the optical head  
and the stepper motor that actuates the attenuation cover mechanism of the    
NavCam.                                                                       
                                                                              
2.1.3  Camera Baffle                                                          
                                                                              
The Camera Baffle provides protection against stray light produced by the Sun 
and reflected from planetary bodies and the satellite. This level of          
protection allows the tracking of faint objects. The baffle is mechanically   
supported by the S/C structure so as to avoid mechanical stress of the optical
head. This is done owing to the required high pointing stability of the camera
boresight in order to achieve the desired accuracy.                           
                                                                              
2.2  Operating Modes                                                          
                                                                              
The following series of operating modes are available in order to exploit the 
capabilities of the NavCam:                                                   
                                                                              
 - Off Mode.                                                                  
 - Initialisation Mode.                                                       
 - Stand-by Mode.                                                             
 - Imaging Mode. In this mode the instrument operates as a standard camera in 
  order to acquire images of star-fields or extended objects in the field of  
  view such as the comet nucleus during the escort phase.                     
  INSTRUMENT MODE ID = "IMAGING"                                              
                                                                              
 - Point Target Tracking Mode. In this mode the NavCam can track              
  simultaneously up to five point-like objects in the field of view.          
                                                                              
 - Asteroid (Extended Object) Tracking Mode. In this mode the NavCam can      
  detect and track an extended object in the eld of view. Optionally          
  information on the position of this object can be fed into the autonomous   
  attitude control system of the spacecraft. (This was done during the        
  asteroid fly-bys.) In the Asteroid Tracking Mode images can also be         
  acquired and downlinked in the same way as in the Imaging Mode.             
  INSTRUMENT MODE ID = "ASTEROID TRACKING"                                    
                                                                              
- Self Test Mode.                                                             
                                                                              
Image data can be generated and downlinked to ground in the Imaging and       
Asteroid (Ex-tended Object) Tracking modes. In the archived datasets, the    
used mode is indicated by the INSTRUMENT MODE ID keyword of the label files   
as indicated above (see also Table 13).                                       
                                                                              
3  Data Handling Process and Product Generation                               
                                                                              
The NavCam data are primarily used by the Flight Dynamics Team of the Rosetta 
Mission Operations Centre (RMOC) located at ESOC in Darmstadt, Germany. The   
images acquired with this camera are essential for determining the spacecraft 
position with respect to the comet nucleus and hence for safely navigating    
Rosetta. In addition, the images are also processed from the raw telemetry    
data at the Rosetta Science Ground Segment (SGS) based at ESAC near Madrid,   
Spain. The data are made available to the Rosetta instrument team community   
shortly after acquisition in order to support analysis and interpretation of  
their scientific data. Later, datasets of the product files are prepared for  
public release via the Planetary Science Archive (PSA).                       
                                                                              
3.1  Telemetry Data                                                           
                                                                              
For generating the product files the following telemetry data are processed:  
                                                                              
 - Science Data Report: TM APID 460 (CAM1) and 476 (CAM2), Type 20,           
Subtype 13. This set of telemetry data contains images as well as a number of 
meta data parameters. The latter are included in the label files of the       
generated data products.                                                      
                                                                              
 - Housekeeping and Health-Check Report: TM APID 452 (CAM1) and 468 (CAM2),   
Type 3, Subtype 25. From the set of available housekeeping parameters only the
CCD temperature and the optics temperature are extracted and included in the  
label files of the generated data products.                                   
                                                                              
3.2  Data Product levels                                                      
                                                                              
Table 5: Data Processing levels.                                              
                                                                              
PSA     |  CODMAC  | Description                                              
1a      |1         | Raw telemetry packet data that have been separated by    
        |          | instrument. This is the level which is distributed by the
        |          | DDS (ESOC).                                              
1b      |2         | level 1a data that have been sorted by instrument data   
        |          | types and instrument modes. Data are in scienti cally    
        |          | useful form, e.g. as images. These data are still        
        |          | uncalibrated.                                            
2       |3         | level 1b data with calibration and corrections applied to
        |          | yield data in scientific units.                          
3       |5         | Higher level data products developed for specific        
        |          | scientific investigations.                               
                                                                              
Table 5 summarises the definition of data product levels according to both PSA
and CODMAC (Committee On Data Management, Archiving, and Computation).        
                                                                              
3.2.1  Uncalibrated Data                                                      
                                                                              
Uncalibrated data, i.e. products at CODMAC level 2, were released for the     
entire cruise phase including images from the Earth and Mars swing-bys as well
as distant (unresolved) navigation images of the visited asteroids 2878 Steins
and 21 Lutetia. Presently the images acquired after hibernation exit during   
the comet approach and escort phases are successively being archived and made 
available. The uncalibrated data products consist of image files with         
extensive meta-information. For each image pixel the original unaltered       
digital number values are given as read out from the CCD.                     

3.2.2  Radiometrically Calibrated Data                                        
                                                                              
Radiometrically calibrated data, i.e. products at CODMAC level 3, are         
currently not yet available but are foreseen to be provided. This requires    
removing artefacts caused by the optical system and the CCD detector from the 
raw images and converting the digital number counts into physical radiance    
units. It is currently not planned by the Rosetta SGS to generate higher level
data products such as map projections on a shape model for the comet nucleus  
images.       

3.2.3  Geometrically Calibrated Data                                          
                                                                              
Accurate geometric information is required for the operational objective of   
the NavCam and the respective image characteristics are therefore well        
established (see Section 4.2.4). However, it is not appropriate to generate   
geometrically calibrated data products by re-sampling the images. The         
correction shall better be taken into account for each specific application by
directly using the existing data products.                                    
                                                                
                                                                              
4  Archive Conventions and Meta-Information                                   
                                                                              
This chapter describes general rules and conventions for producing the        
datasets and also gives an overview of important meta-information included in 
the product files.                                                            
                                                                              
4.1  Format and Conventions                                                   
                                                                              
The directory tree must be compatible, in terms of directory organisation and 
naming and file organisation, with the PDS standards and such that:           
                                                                              
 - each logical archive volume shall contain one NavCam PDS dataset;         
 datasets will contain data from both NavCams;                               
                                                                              
 - one dataset shall be created for each separate mission phase; a different 
  dataset shall be created for each processing level;                        
                                                                              
 - the top level directory of each logical archive volume shall match that of 
  the NavCam dataset ID; and,                                                
                                                                              
 - the volume set name shall be as that of the dataset.                      
                                                                              
4.1.1  Dataset ID Formation                                                  
                                                                              
The dataset ID formation shall be done according to the following rule:      
                                                                              
DATA SET ID = <INST HOST>-<TARGET ID>-<INST>-<CODMAC fileVEL>-                
                                                                              
<MISSION PHASE ABBREVIATION>-<VERSION>                                        
                                                                              
Each of the components are described, briefly, in Table 6, with a list of     
options for TARGET_ID and MISSION_PHASE being given in Tables 7 and 8         
respectively. Examples include:                                               
                                                                              
 RO-X-NAVCAM-2-PRL-COM-V1.0                                                   
                                                                              
 RO-C-NAVCAM-2-PRL-MTP004-V1.0                                                
                                                                              
In some instances there are several TARGET ID terms in the DATA SET ID naming 
formation. These terms are combined and included in a list, separated by

4.1.2  File Naming Convention                                                 
                                                                              
Each image data product is generated in the form of a binary file (*.IMG) and 
a FITS-format file (*.FIT) with associated label files (*.LBL) of the same    
name that point to the image file. The label files contain meta-information   
about the camera operating parameters and geometric conditions. For every     
image a browse version file (*.JPG) with reduced resolution and an associated 
label file are created. The file naming convention for these files is as      
follows:

The parameter <YYYYMMDDThhmmss> is the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)       
without the fractional seconds (see Section 4.1.4) and provides the date and  
time at which the image was acquired on-board the spacecraft.                 
                                                                              
4.1.3  PDS Standards                                                          
                                                                              
Each complete volume produced will be compliant with both the PDS and PSA     
standards. In general each individual file is created using PDS Version 3     
standards. The PDS format uses the ISO 9660 level 2 standard for the file     
names. Hence, no complete file name shall be longer than 31 characters and the
"27.3" structure shall be obeyed, that is, a maximum of 27 characters before  
the "." for the file name and 3 characters after for the extension type.      
                                                                              
4.1.4  Time Standards                                                         
                                                                              
Two time standards are used in the meta-information of the NavCam data        
product files:                                                                
                                                                              
 - UTC is expressed in the format <YYYYMMDDThhmmss.fff>                       
    where YYYYMMDD provides the calendar date (year, month and day), T is a   
    fixed separator and hhmmss. fff indicates the time in hours, minutes,     
    seconds and fractions of a second. UTC is used in the following keywords  
    for time stamping the data products:                                      
                                                                              
     - PRODUCT_CREATION_TIME                                                  
     - IMAGE_TIME                                                             
     - START_TIME                                                             
     - STOP_TIME                                                              
                                                                              
Here START_TIME = IMAGE_TIME - 0.5 EXPOSURE_DURATION and                      
STOP_TIME = IMAGE TIME + 0.5 EXPOSURE TIME.                                   
                                                                              
 - Spacecraft Clock Time is given in the format                               
    1/<time counter high value>.<time counter low value>                      
    where the high counter roughly corresponds to the number of seconds since 
    initialisation, and the low value counts ticks of duration 1/65536        
    second. (Example: 1/123772074.26377). The following keywords contain      
    spacecraft clock time:                                                    
        - SPACECRAFT CLOCK START COUNT                                        
        - SPACECRAFT CLOCK STOP COUNT                                         

For datasets up to and including MTP012 rounding errors of 1ms can occurr in the 
START_TIME and STOP_TIME keyword values due to an inappropriate computation procedure.
                              
4.2  Reference Frames and Geometry                                            
                                                                              
4.2.1  Camera Reference Frames                                                
                                                                              
For data processing and analysis purposes the NavCam reference frames are     
defined as follows:                                                           
                                                                              
 - The +Z axis points along the camera boresight (optical axis).              
                                                                              
 - The +X axis is parallel to the apparent image columns. It is nominally     
  co-aligned with the S/C +X axis.                                            
                                                                              
 - The +Y axis completes the right hand frame. It is nominally parallel to    
  the apparent image lines and co-aligned with the S/C +Y axis.               
                                                                              
 - The origin of the frame is located at the camera focal point.              

The actual NavCam boresight directions in the spacecraft reference frame were 
determined by in-flight calibration and are as follows.

CAM1 (NAVCAM-A): ( -0.000584, -0.003128, 0.999995 ).
CAM2 (NAVCAM-B): (  0.000116,  0.002098, 0.999998 ).

The full alignment rotation matrices are specified in the Rosetta SPICE 
frame-kernel [RD4]. Note that the values for CAM1 were updated in version 2.5 
of the frame-kernel, which has been used for generating the archive datasets 
(V1.0) from period MTP018 onwards.
                                                                              
4.2.2  Image Orientation                                                      
                                                                              
The images in the data product files are oriented such that the CCD columns   
(and therefore the X axis) appear in vertical direction and the lines (and    
therefore the Y axis) in horizontal direction. The binary files start with    
the first byte of the first line read out from the CCD. This first line       
corresponds to the bottom of the image in the orientation mentioned above.    
Accordingly, the relevant keywords in the image description section of the    
product label files are specified as SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION = "RIGHT" and   
LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION = "UP".                                                
                                                                              
The orientation of the X and Y axes is such that line and column number counts
increase with increasing coordinate value. However, the optics of the         
instrument introduces an inversion of the image. This means that the signs of 
both coordinate values need to be reversed when transforming the position of  
an object in space into image coordinates. Or in other words, the image needs 
to be rotated by 180 degrees in order to match the orientation of the imaged  
scene.                                                                        
                                                                              
4.2.3  Window Size and Position                                               
                                                                              
The camera software allows the user to specify sub-frames in order to reduce  
the data volume for downlink. In the product label files the size of the      
images is indicated by the standard keywords LINES and LINE_SAMPLES of the    
image description section. The specific keywords                              
ROSETTA:CAM_WINDOW_POS_ALONG_ROW                                              
and                                                                           
ROSETTA:CAM_WINDOW_POS_ALONG_COL,                                             
respectively, indicate the central column and row numbers of the commanded    
sub-images (see Table 14). For full images with 1024x1024 pixels the value of 
both of these keywords is set to 511, which corresponds to the centre of the  
CCD.                                                                          
                                                                              
4.2.4  Geometric Calibration                                                  

The optical system of the camera is designed in such a way that geometric 
distortion over the whole field of view is small (~1% at the edge). Nevertheless
for the purposes of precise navigation and astrometric registration these effects 
need to be taken into account. The simplified procedure below for computing the 
view direction as a function of image pixel was extracted from Appendix H of the 
Data Delivery Interface Document [RD5]. It is accurate to one pixel over the full CCD.

For a given pixel position (i, j) on the camera CCD, the corresponding direction 
vector (x, y, z) in camera frame can be obtained as follows with parameter values 
as listed in Table 10:

Convert pixel coordinates into spatial position in the detector plane relative to 
the image centre:
px=(i-511)*0.013
py=(j-511)*0.013.

Apply a radial distortion correction relative to the linear position:
pxCorr=px*[1+cx*(px^2+py^2)]
pyCorr=py*[1+cy*(px^2+py^2)].

The (un-normalised) direction vector in camera frame is then given by:
(x, y, z) = (-pxCorr/fx, -pyCorr/fy, 1).

The sign change in x- and y-coordinates assures the appropriate image orientation as 
mentioned in Section 4.2.2.

4.2.5  Geometric Information in Label Files                                   
                                                                              
The label files include the following geometric variables:                    
                                                                              
 - SC_SUN_POSITION_VECTOR                                                     
   The vector from the spacecraft to the Sun in equatorial J2000 inertial     
   frame.                                                                     
                                                                              
 - SC_TARGET_POSITION_VECTOR                                                  
   The vector from the spacecraft to the centre of the comet nucleus in       
   equatorial J2000 inertial frame.                                           
                                                                              
 - SC_TARGET_VELOCITY_VECTOR                                                  
    The spacecraft to comet nucleus velocity vector in in equatorial J2000    
    inertial frame.                                                           
                                                                              
 - TARGET_CENTER_DISTANCE                                                     
    The distance between the spacecraft and the comet nucleus centre.         
    (Note that also for checkout and stellar calibration images the comet     
    nucleus distance is given here.)                                          
                                                                              
 - SUB_SPACECRAFT_LATITUDE and SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE                       
    The latitude and longitude of the sub-spacecraft point derived from the   
    Flight Dynamics body-fixed reference frame implicitly specified by the    
    information provided in the comet attitude file CATT [RD5].
    By construction the "Cheops reference frame" introduced in [RD6,RD7] is 
    equivalent to the Flight Dynamics body-fixed frame.              
                                                                              
 - RIGHT ASCENSION and DECLINATION                                            
    Right Ascension and Declination of the camera boresight direction in      
    equatorial J2000 inertial frame.                                          
                                                                              
 - CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE                                                
    The direction of celestial north at the centre of the image - measured    
    from the 'upward' direction, clockwise to the direction toward            
    celestial north.                                                          
                                                                              
 - SOLAR_ELONGATION                                                           
    The angle between the line of sight of observation and the direction to   
    the Sun.                                                                  
                                                                              
All geometric values are calculated for the time t = IMAGE_TIME (and not      
START_TIME). The values of the keywords SC_SUN_POSITION_VECTOR, 
SC_TARGET_POSITION_VECTOR, SC_TARGET_VELOCITY_VECTOR, and TARGET_CENTER_DISTANCE 
are determined taking into account light time and aberration corrections.
RIGHT_ASCENSION and DECLINATION are computed with aberration corrections. 
No correction is applied for obtaining the values of SUB_SPACECRAFT_LATITUDE and
SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE.
                                                                              
4.3  Data Quality                                                             
                                                                              
The keyword DATA_QUALITY_ID indicates whether the lines of an image were      
completely acquired (value 0) or the image is incomplete and lines are missing
(value 1). The number of missing lines is given in the Rosetta mission        
specific keyword ROSETTA:CAM_MISSING_LINES (see Table 14).                    
                                                                              
The keyword ROSETTA:CAM_DATA_VALID with the possible values OK or NOT OK      
reports the result of a periodic instrument health check which is included in 
the science telemetry data. This error flag is set, for example, if the       
instrument CCD temperature is not within the performance range of [-25 C,0 C].
This is the case for a large fraction of the images taken during the comet    
escort phase. However, the lower temperatures measured are still within the   
operating range and do not affect the image quality.                          

Instrument temperatures are extracted from housekeeping telemetry (see Section 3.1).
If for a given image acquisition time no housekeeping information is available 
in an interval of +/- 1 minute the values are reported as "UNK" in the keyword 
INSTRUMENT_TEMPERATURE.

4.4  Observation Type                                                         
                                                                              
The keyword OBSERVATION TYPE was used in the label files in order to provide  
information about the purpose of the images acquired. The values of the keyword 
are as follows:
                                                                              
 - NAVIGATION IMAGE                                                           
    The image was commanded for navigation purposes by the Flight Dynamics    
    team.                                                                     
                                                                              
 - CONTEXT IMAGE                                                              
    The image was requested by the instrument team community via the Science  
    Ground Segment in order to provide context information for other scientific 
    measurements. From August 2015 additional context images were also scheduled 
    directly by the Science Ground Segment for regular activity monitoring 
    around perihelion.                                                 
                                                                              
 - CALIBRATION                                                                
    The image was acquired for calibration purposes. This also includes images 
    specifically scheduled for characterising the dust environment. 
                                                                              
 - CHECKOUT                                                                   
    The image was acquired as an instrument checkout or test.                 

The TARGET_NAME keyword is always specified as "67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO 1 (1969 R1)"
for navigation and context images, although the latter also include a large number of
instances for which the comet nucleus is not in the field of view.

5  Dataset Content

The dataset naming for the Rosetta NavCam follows the following              
formation rule:

Sub-directories (except the DATA and EXTRAS directories) include a file, 
xxxxINFO.TXT, that briefly describes the contents of that directory. In case 
that an important instrument characteristic cannot be described with an 
existing PDS keyword, the information will be supplied in a separate parameter 
file.

This directory contains one or two sub-directories (CAM1 and/or CAM2) with a  
set of thumbnail images in *.JPG format (one corresponding to each *.IMG file 
in the DATA directory) and an associated *.LBL for each one. Other files that 
are included here are:  

 - BROWINFO.TXT: This file describes the contents of the directory.           
 - *.LBL: Detached label files for the browse products.                       
 - *.JPG: Browse product images of reduced size in JPEG format. These         
  thumbnail images were created from the raw binary data using the convert    
  tool of the ImageMagick package (v6.8.9-6) and standard parameter settings  
  (-contrast-stretch 2%x1%). The grey scale conversion from the raw data was  
  not tuned to specific image contents and therefore in some cases the        
  resulting image can be dominated by detector noise.

According to the PDS formatting standard, each data product must be           
accompanied by a descriptive *.LBL to describe the content. For the NavCam    
these label files shall be in the detached form and will appear as separate   
files (see Section 4.1.2). The image data are provided in binary as well as in
a FITS format version. There are separate label files for each of them. The 
product file versions in binary format with their PDS format label files are 
stored in the DATA directory, whereas the FITS format image files and their 
label files are contained in the EXTRAS directory.

The following shall remain true for all label files in all volumes for the    
Rosetta NavCam:                                                               
                                                                              
 - The format follows PDS standards for formatting and character usage.       
                                                                              
 - The labels shall use only valid keywords that appear in both the PDS and   
 PSA dictionaries.                                                            
                                                                              
 - The character set used shall be that of ASCII 7 bit; specifically          
 characters within and including the code range 001 to 127.                   
                                                                              
 - The characters <CR> and <LF> shall be used and shall be present at the end 
 of each line of every label file.                                            
                                                                              
 - Each label file shall not exceed a maximum 80-character limit; including   
 the <CR> <LF> characters.                                                    
                                                                              
 - Every line that is less than the permitted 80 character maximum shall be   
 padded out to be of a length equal to 80.

The values of the keywords SC_SUN_POSITION_VECTOR, SC_TARGET_POSITION_VECTOR, 
SC_TARGET_VELOCITY_VECTOR, CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, RIGHT_ASCENSION, and  
DECLINATION are related to the equatorial J2000 inertial frame.               
The values of SUB_SPACECRAFT_LATITUDE and SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE refer to   
the Cheops reference frame which is identical to the Flight Dynamics          
body-fixed frame implicitly specified by the information provided in the      
comet attitude file CATT.

6.2  Content of *.FIT File Header                                             
                                                                              
The labels for the FITS-format file versions contain identical                
meta-information and only minor changes owing to the di erences of the image  
file format. The *.FIT image files also contain meta-data in their header so  
that the files can be used independently of the PDS dataset structure.        
Astrometric registration information is included in the form of WCS keywords. 
However, the geometric distortion (see Section 4.2.4) towards the edge of the 
field of view is not modelled here. Table 15 shows the correspondence between 
PDS and FITS keywords used in the label file and the header, respectively.

Note: For the FITS-WCS keywords CRPIX1 and CRPIX2, respectively, the convention 
is such that the counts start with 1.0 in the centre of the first row and column. 
The coordinates of the centre of a full-frame image are therefore (512.5, 512.5).

The datasets created and archived for the Rosetta cruise phase did not contain
FITS-versions of the product files. In addition, the label files only         
contained a reduced set of keywords. For reference Tables 16 and 17 are       
maintained which summarise the available information as applicable in earlier 
versions of this document.
